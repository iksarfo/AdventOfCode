Day 01:

- C# implementation took no time but the solution looks + feels clunky!
- Python took longer (given unfamiliarity) but is easier to read
- Clojure took longest, is compact and was the most satisying to write

Day 02:
- F# implementation dispelled any notion of remembering the language beyond the basics
