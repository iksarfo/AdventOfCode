- C# implementation took no time but the solution looks + feels clunky!
- Python took longer (given unfamiliarity) but is easier to read
- Clojure took longest, is compact and was the most satisfying to write

--- **Day 2:** [1202 Program Alarm](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) ---
- F# implementation dispelled any notion of remembering the language beyond the basics

--- **Day 3:** [Crossed Wires](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3) ---
- Python is more enjoyable when using a REPL (duh)

--- **Day 4:** [Secure Container](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4) ---
- Clojure felt okay. Took longer than I'd expected :(
- Much easier to write in F#

--- **Day 5:** [Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5) ---
- I really didn't want to do this in F#
- Trying to do this 'idiomatically' was a bit painful and there's nothing gained by not mutating memory in place
- Spent ages debugging when the code was already working
- Infinitely easier coding during the evening!
