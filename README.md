**--- Day 1: [The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1) ---**
- C# implementation took no time but the solution looks + feels clunky!
- Python took longer (given unfamiliarity) but is easier to read
- Clojure took longest, is compact and was the most satisfying to write

**--- Day 2: [1202 Program Alarm](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) ---**
- F# implementation dispelled any notion of remembering the language beyond the basics

**--- Day 3: [Crossed Wires](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3) ---**
- Python is more enjoyable when using a REPL (duh)

**--- Day 4: [Secure Container](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4) ---**
- Clojure felt okay. Took longer than I'd expected :(
- Much easier to write in F#

**--- Day 5: [Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5) ---**
- I really didn't want to do this in F#
- Trying to do this 'idiomatically' wasn't fun
- Nothing gained by not mutating memory in place
- Spent ages debugging (code was already working correctly)
- Easier coding during the evening!

**--- Day 6: [Universal Orbit Map](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6) ---**
- Fun problem
- Just Pthon syntax to contend with
- Succinct problem definitions allow for less ambiguity

**--- Day 7: [Amplification Circuit](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/7) ---**
- I didn't fancy this one yet...
- The problem definition wasn't clear to me (and only me it seems)
- Right now my preference is to use Python/C# for this kind of thing

**--- Day 8: [Space Image Format](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8) ---**
- Silly bug
- Mind the bad habits when coding tired
- Getting the answer is one thing
- The Pythonic is something else

**--- Day 9: [Amplification Circuit](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/7) ---**
- Skipped... *yawn*

**--- Day 10: [Monitoring Station](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10) ---**
- Favourite problem so far
- It's hard writing Clojure tired
- The lack of types meant it was necessary to memorise the arguments' data structures
- Probably worth using [spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) for future problems
